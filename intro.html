								<h2>About Me</h2>
                                <p>Hey and thanks for stopping by my website! My name is Daniel Xu, and I'm currently a 3rd-year Computer Science student at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. I was born and raised in the nearby Research Triangle area -- one of the largest research parks in the US and home to many tech companies -- so you could say I was destined for technology :) While North Carolina has always been my home, I enjoy traveling and learning from experiences around the world. The picture above was taken in Copenhagen, Denmark during my exchange semester!
                                </p>
								<p>My journey into Computer Science started with my interest in games. It began in 7th grade when I joined my school's coding club and began to make games using Scratch. That year, I had the opportunity to visit the Epic Games Headquarters in Cary, an experience I will never forget. Fast forward to today, I continue to use and build off skills I've gathered along the way for my projects in data science, app development, and web development. In the future, I aspire to leverage technology to connect people and solve real-world problems.
								</p>
								<p>Outside of Computer Science, I'm enthusiastic about content creation, foreign languages, music, and sports. In content creation, I enjoy documenting my life and sharing my stories with family, friends, and everyone. With my content, others can learn from my experiences, and I can also look back on the past and reflect on myself. Through my other hobbies, I've been able to meet new people and embrace newideas from different communities. I'm always proud to say my diverse interests have shaped me into an open-minded and well-rounded student with an edge in STEM.
								</p>
								<p>I look forward to a bright future as I continue learn and work towards advancing technology and my goals to bring people together and promote sustainability.
								</p>
