								<h2>About Me</h2>
                                <p>Hello! I'm Daniel Xu, a third-year Computer Science student at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, 
									originally from the nearby Research Triangle area. My journey into the world of Computer Science started 
									with a curiosity for how technology shapes our lives, and it has since become a passion that drives my academic and professional pursuits.
									Two of the things I enjoy most about programming are as follows: innovation and problem-solving.
                                </p>
								<p>I’m committed to leveraging technology to solve real-world problems, particularly in the areas of digital health and productivity. 
									My academic and professional journey have been enriched by experiences like studying abroad at the University of Copenhagen, where I delved into Databases 
									and Software Development for Digital Health, and working as a Mobile Engineer Intern at Fidelity Investments, where I gained real-world experiences in Agile
									Methodologies and software projects.
								</p>
								<p>Beyond my academic and professional interests, I’m also passionate about content creation. I run my own YouTube channel, where I document my life 
									and share experiences that others, and I, can learn and reflect on. Music has always been a significant part of my life—I started piano and trumpet at a young age and was in the marching band at 
									UNC during my 1st and 2nd years. I'm also enthusiastic about sports and foreign languages, all of which have allowed me to meet new people and consider different perspectives. 
								</p>
								<p>
								Fluent in English and Chinese and studying French, I enjoy connecting with diverse teams and contributing to global projects. I aspire to develop applications and innovative projects 
								that tackle societal challenges and improve everyday life through technology.
								</p>
